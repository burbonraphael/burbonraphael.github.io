                <h3>First idea</h3>
                <h3>StandUpForUkraineToken </h3>
                <p><strong>Dec'23/Jan'24</strong></p>
                <p>Here is our first product. We hope there will be more of them.</p>
                <p> We are trying to make a crypto currency that will provide a constant support for Ukraine by giving them 10% of all mined coins,
            enables instant, private payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. UkraineCoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: 
            managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. UkraineCoin Core is the name 
            of the open source software which enables the use of this currency. No matter from which part of world you are from, above the borders. 
            We are trying to establish contact with Ukrainian Gouvernment.</p>

                <h3>How does it work? Idea </h3>
                <p> In the time of ongoing tragic war in the Ukraine, a group of people decided to create the StandUpForUkraineToken, a Token (which is a cryptocurrency) with very easy idea. 10% of the amount from each transaction goes to the special wallet on metamask: </p>
<p>0xea1fDC0223005f1e6ee8862cC1Bb7bD2c50867FB </p>
<p>This money are being given to the Ukrainian Gouvernment to makes sure they can fight against Russian Federation and resist against occupation.
1 000 000 Tokens is created each month and transfered to the wallets that makes transactions. Once you send  tokens to someone, you are making blockchaina alive, so you have to be rewarded. The percentage of all transactions are the percentage of your rewrad out of this every month 1 000 000 tokens.
And once you do the transfer, 10% goes to Ukrain immidiately.

                    In the shadow of the widely known group of hackers, known as 'Anonymous,' there exists another mysterious organization that operates in complete anonymity but with an entirely different purpose. These are not hackers but 'Anonymous Creators' – a group of individuals whose desire to change the world directs them towards art, activism, and the creation of content with the potential to transform society.
We do the non-profit projects that might help the world and make it better place to live. Our first idea is StandUpForUkraineToken.
New part of The Anonymous which is focused on making projects 
            and products that are helping voiceless in the world rather than hacking bad people (what we support too). 
            Organization is non-profit, established on 24th of November 2023.</p>
